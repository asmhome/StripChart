# StripChart
Major Update Posted


StripChart.py is a class.

RunStripChart.py will use the StripChart.py class to build a single strip chart window

DictionarySender.py is for simulation only.  It sends dictionary data using 'pickle' encoding.

Note:  the dictionary data send MUST be ordered.

A new version called StripChartSlider.py can be used to replace StripChart.py 

It uses slider controls for chart speed and chart zoom function instead of buttons.

A new version called RunStripChartSlider.py is included to run the new version

DictionarySender.py can be used with either version
